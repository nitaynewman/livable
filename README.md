Part 2.
In my code I created 4 functions.
1. get_data function. This function gets the data from the user and and defines the data.
2. initialize_database function. This function creates and defines the sql database in order to store the data.
3. save_database function. This function takes the data from the get_data function and saves it in the database.
4. retrieve_data function. get all the data in the database and present in in the console.
Then in the main function I put all the functions together in a while loop so that it will present 3 options:
1. add new data.
2. get all the data.
3. exit
